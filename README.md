# funchat

A basic chat application where predetermined responses will mess with people. Additionally, users can upload text files to generate embeddings from a pretrained model, which are stored in a vector database. Queries are fetched based on these embeddings.

## TODO
- Adding a delete option for messages
- On deletion of a user's message, the computer will be curious
- AI Integration: Depending on the mood of the conversation, the background of the app will change dynamically

## Limitations
- Lack of responsive design
- Limitations of borders and paddings
